            <div class="course-content">
                <p class="course-text">In September 2023, I embarked on an exciting journey with my Access course, a stepping stone towards my dream university. More than just a preparation, it's my ticket to success, as it encompasses various subjects crucial for university admission. Over the span of a year, I delve into nearly 10 diverse subjects, each holding its own significance. Among them, three stand out as my absolute favorites: Web Design, Computing Programming, and Object-Oriented Programming. These subjects not only captivate my interest but also fuel my passion for learning and innovation.</p>

            <h2 class="course-title">Web Design</h2>
            <div class="course-content">
                <p class="course-text">Web Design, with its focus on HTML and CSS, is a captivating journey into the world of website development. The intricacies within each element make it both fascinating and demanding. Personally, mastering CSS poses the greatest challenge due to its myriad classifications and diverse approaches to achieving desired outcomes.
                    <br><br>My inaugural Web Design assignment tasked me with crafting a website, integrating essential HTML and CSS components like headings, images, and bold fonts. Dive into the result by clicking <a href="https://matheusguarnier.github.io/WebTest/"><b>here</b></a>.
                    <br><br>Another stimulating assignment involved deploying a website online using hosting services. Here, the selection of the hosting provider was pivotal. I meticulously justified my choice based on the provider's features and conveniences. Explore the hosted website <a href="https://matheusguarnier.github.io/Hosting-Solution/"><b>here</b></a>.

        <div class="course">
            <h2 class="course-title">Computing Programming</h2>
            <div class="course-content">
                <p class="course-text">Computing Programming immerses students in the world of Python programming. Through this subject, I delved into Procedural Programming, fundamental Python concepts, and Computational Thinking. Additionally, we honed our skills in utilizing Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), pivotal platforms for writing and executing code.
                    <br><br>The highlight of this course was undoubtedly the creation of various programs, ranging from a cash machine simulator to an engaging Q&A game. The boundless creativity afforded by this subject makes it my absolute favorite, offering endless opportunities for innovation and exploration.</p>

            <h2 class="course-title">Object-Oriented Prorgamming</h2>
            <div class="course-content">
                <p class="course-text">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduces students to a programming paradigm centered around objects and data, contrasting with the procedural approach focused on functions and logic. Widely regarded as the dominant programming paradigm today, OOP's emphasis on real-world abstraction makes it immensely popular.
                    <br><br>Personally, I'm drawn to OOP not only for its practical relevance but also for its utilization of Python, a language I deeply enjoy. The fusion of theoretical concepts with hands-on Python programming makes OOP a captivating and rewarding subject for me.</p>
